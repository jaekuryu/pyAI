# Documentation Rules and Guidelines

## Core Principle
**Always review the document structure first, then update in the right places** - Never add content randomly or at the end without understanding the existing organization.

## Documentation Update Process

### 1. Review First
- **Always read the existing document** to understand its structure, sections, and organization
- Identify the logical placement for new content within existing sections
- Respect the established hierarchy and flow
- Look for existing related content that might need updating alongside new additions

### 2. Update in Context
- **Place new content in the appropriate existing sections** rather than creating redundant sections
- **Enhance existing sections** with new information where it logically belongs
- **Maintain consistency** with existing formatting, style, and terminology
- **Preserve the document's intended flow** and logical progression

### 3. Integration Over Addition
- **Integrate new features into existing workflows** rather than treating them as separate entities
- **Show relationships** between new and existing functionality
- **Update cross-references** and related sections when adding new content
- **Maintain backward compatibility** in documentation structure

### 4. Update Order
- **Add the latest update at the beginning of the relevant section or changelog.**  
  When documenting updates, always insert the newest information at the top of the update list or changelog section. This ensures that readers see the most recent changes first, improving visibility and usability.


## Content Quality Standards

### Technical Accuracy
- **Verify all code examples** and API formats are correct
- **Test command syntax** and parameter formats
- **Validate endpoint URLs** and request/response structures
- **Ensure consistency** between documentation and implementation

### Completeness
- **Document all parameters** with types and descriptions
- **Include error handling** and edge cases
- **Provide usage examples** for complex features
- **Explain integration points** between different components

### Clarity and Organization
- **Use consistent formatting** throughout the document
- **Maintain logical section hierarchy** (H1 → H2 → H3)
- **Provide clear section navigation** with table of contents
- **Use descriptive headings** that clearly indicate content

### Maintenance
- **Update related sections** when adding new features
- **Remove outdated information** when functionality changes
- **Maintain cross-references** between related documentation
- **Keep examples current** with latest implementation

## Common Patterns to Follow

### When Adding New Features
1. **Identify the logical parent section** in existing documentation
2. **Review related existing content** for consistency
3. **Add to appropriate subsections** rather than creating new top-level sections
4. **Update cross-references** in other parts of the document
5. **Enhance summary/overview sections** to include new capabilities

### When Updating Existing Features
1. **Find all references** to the feature throughout the document
2. **Update consistently** across all mentions
3. **Preserve backward compatibility** information where relevant
4. **Update examples** to reflect current best practices

### When Reorganizing Content
1. **Maintain existing section structure** unless major restructuring is needed
2. **Preserve internal links** and cross-references
3. **Keep related content together** logically
4. **Update table of contents** and navigation elements

## Quality Checklist

Before completing documentation updates:

- [ ] **Structure Review**: Content placed in logical, existing sections
- [ ] **Consistency Check**: Formatting matches existing document style
- [ ] **Completeness Verification**: All new features/endpoints documented
- [ ] **Cross-Reference Update**: Related sections updated appropriately
- [ ] **Example Validation**: Code examples and API formats verified
- [ ] **Navigation Update**: Table of contents and internal links current
- [ ] **Summary Enhancement**: Overview sections reflect new capabilities

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't Do This
- Adding new content at the end of documents randomly
- Creating duplicate sections for related functionality
- Ignoring existing document structure and organization
- Writing verbose descriptions without clear technical value
- Forgetting to update related sections when adding new features
- Using inconsistent formatting or terminology
- Adding content without understanding the existing context

### ✅ Do This Instead
- Review document structure and place content appropriately
- Enhance existing sections with new related functionality
- Maintain consistent organization and hierarchy
- Write concise, technically accurate descriptions
- Update all related sections when making changes
- Follow established formatting patterns
- Understand the document's purpose and audience before adding content

## Usage Instructions

When requesting documentation updates, reference this file by saying:

**"Apply docrules.md when updating [document name]"**

This ensures consistent, well-organized documentation that integrates seamlessly with existing content while maintaining high quality and usability standards.
